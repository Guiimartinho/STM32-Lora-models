	Toogles the reset pin (from HIGH -> LOW -> HIGH).

    The RN2483 module transmits it's firmware version upon being reset, so if the version is successful.

    @return RN2483_SUCCESS if version was succesfully retrieved after toggling the RESET pin
    @return RN2483_ERR_PANIC if version was not retrieved after toggling the RESET pin

    Triggers the autobaud detction sequence by sending a break, setting the baudrate and sending 0x55.

    The new baudrate is tested by attempting to retrieve the firmware version.

    @return RN2483_SUCCESS if RN2483_firmware() succeeded after autobaud.

	config.h) to communicate over a LoRaWAN network.
